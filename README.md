This is my portfolio.
In this project I have worked with vite and also added some parallax effect from react-parallax dependency. In my package.json file you can see all my dependencies that I have used for this project. I used redux to get my api from my github because I found this a bit extra challenging. My portfolio contains various components such as home/about/github and contact.

The portfolio is something that I will sit with more during the summer as I don't feel that it is completely finished in terms of style. But I hope it covers the criteria for this submission.
