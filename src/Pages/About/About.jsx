            <p>
              I am a happy and passionate guy who loves to get to know new
              people
            </p>
            <p>
              In my spare time I spend time with my family, go for walks in
              nature with my dog ​​and now that I have found an interest that I
              am passionate about, I also sit and code.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have always found technology very interesting already quite
              early in my upbringing.
            </p>
            <p>
              My interest grew greatly when I got my first moped. It was fun to
              drive but it was more interesting how it actually works. So I
              became a mechanic. Today's cars are built with a lot of software
              and this sparked my interest in code as I found it interesting how
              it works behind the scenes.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to this, I always liked to paint and be creative as a
              young person and then I found frontend development that suited me
              on all levels. The social, the creativity and the technical.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my career in the automotive industry, I have had to work a
              lot with people, in teams and individually. Being a good team
              player is something I value highly.
            </p>
            <p>
              I don't have much experience in the IT industry, but I can promise
              you that you will not regret having me on your team. And I will do
              what it takes to become a good developer.
